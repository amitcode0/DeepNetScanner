# Practical No-04

## Aim

**Modeling UML Use Case Diagrams and Capturing Use Case Scenarios**

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to understand how to model use case diagrams and capture use case scenarios for a system, specifically focusing on the **Development and Implementation of a Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool**.

## Introduction

A **Use Case Diagram** is a fundamental tool in **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** used to visualize the functional requirements of a system. It helps in identifying various **actors** (users or external systems interacting with the system) and their interactions with different functionalities (**use cases**). This diagram acts as a bridge between developers, end-users, and domain experts, ensuring a common understanding of the system requirements.

## Theory

### Use Case Diagram

A use case diagram consists of:

- **Actors:** Entities that interact with the system.
- **Use Cases:** Functionalities that the system provides to the actors.
- **Relationships:** Associations between actors and use cases, which can be:
  - **Association (Simple connection)**
  - **Generalization (Inheritance among use cases/actors)**
  - **Include (Mandatory use case inclusion)**
  - **Extend (Optional use case inclusion based on conditions)**

---

## Identifying Actors and Use Cases

### Primary Actors

1. **Network Administrator** - Responsible for configuring and managing network scanning and packet sniffing.
2. **System User** - Uses the tool for monitoring and analyzing network traffic.

### Supporting Actors

1. **Database System** - Stores scanned results and logs.
2. **Firewall System** - Interacts with the tool to analyze network security.

### Identified Use Cases

1. **Perform Network Scan**
2. **Capture Network Packets**
3. **Analyze Network Traffic**
4. **Generate Reports**
5. **User Authentication**
6. **Save Scan Logs**
7. **Configure Network Settings**
8. **Filter Network Data**

## Graphical Representation - Use Case Diagram

(A well-labeled UML Use Case Diagram illustrating the actors, use cases, and relationships should be drawn here.)

## Relationships Between Actors and Use Cases

1. **Network Administrator** → {Perform Network Scan, Configure Network Settings, Save Scan Logs, Generate Reports}
2. **System User** → {Capture Network Packets, Analyze Network Traffic, Filter Network Data}
3. **Database System** → {Save Scan Logs, Retrieve Scan History}
4. **Firewall System** → {Analyze Network Traffic}

---

## Use Case Relationships

1. **Include Relationship:**

   - "Generate Reports" **includes** "Analyze Network Traffic"
   - "Perform Network Scan" **includes** "Save Scan Logs"

2. **Extend Relationship:**
   - "Capture Network Packets" **extends** "Analyze Network Traffic"
   - "Filter Network Data" **extends** "Capture Network Packets"

---

## Case Study

### Scenario: Performing a Network Scan

1. **Precondition:** The administrator logs in and selects the scan type.
2. **Main Flow:**
   - The system starts scanning the network for connected devices and open ports.
   - Results are displayed in real-time.
   - The scan logs are saved for future reference.
3. **Alternative Flow:** If the scan fails due to network issues, an error message is displayed, and the user can retry.
4. **Postcondition:** The results are stored, and reports can be generated.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we successfully identified actors and use cases for a **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool**. We established relationships between use cases, represented them in a UML use case diagram, and captured a detailed use case scenario. This process helps in understanding system functionality, improving clarity in software development.
