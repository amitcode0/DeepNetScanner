**Practical No-05**  
**Modeling Data Flow Diagram & Control Flow Diagram**

### **Aim of the Experiment:**

To develop and implement a Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing tool to analyze network traffic, detect security vulnerabilities, and monitor network activity in real-time.

---

### **Introduction:**

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** is a graphical representation used to visualize how data flows within a system. It helps in identifying the system’s boundaries, external entities, processes, and data stores.

A **Control Flow Diagram (CFD)** represents the flow of control within a system, describing decision points, loops, and the sequence of operations. Both DFDs and CFDs are essential for understanding system functionality and interactions.

---

### **Objectives:**

After completing this experiment, you will be able to:

- Identify external entities and functionalities of a system.
- Understand and visualize the flow of data across the system.
- Represent the data flow with Data Flow Diagrams.
- Understand control flow representation using Control Flow Diagrams.

### **Theory:**

#### **Data Flow Diagram (DFD):**

A Data Flow Diagram consists of four key components:

1. **External Entities** – Sources or destinations of data (e.g., User, Network, Database).
2. **Processes** – Activities that transform incoming data into outgoing data.
3. **Data Stores** – Repositories where data is stored for future use.
4. **Data Flows** – Arrows representing data movement between components.

#### **Graphical Notations for DFD:**

- **Rectangle:** Represents external entities.
- **Circle/Oval:** Represents processes.
- **Parallel Lines:** Represents data stores.
- **Arrows:** Represents data flow.

#### **Explanation of Symbols Used in DFD:**

| Symbol         | Meaning         |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Rectangle      | External Entity |
| Circle/Oval    | Process         |
| Parallel Lines | Data Store      |
| Arrow          | Data Flow       |

#### **Context Diagram and Leveling DFD:**

A **Context Diagram** is the highest level of a DFD, showing the entire system as a single process connected to external entities.

**Leveling DFD** involves breaking down processes into finer levels (Level 0, Level 1, etc.) to show detailed interactions.

### **Case Study: Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool**

**Entities:**

- **User** – Initiates network scan and packet sniffing.
- **Network Scanner Tool** – Performs scanning of network devices and ports.
- **Packet Sniffer** – Captures and analyzes network packets.
- **Database** – Stores scan logs and network activity.

**Processes:**

1. **User Login & Authentication**
2. **Perform Network Scan**
3. **Capture Network Packets**
4. **Analyze Network Traffic**
5. **Generate Security Reports**
6. **Store Scan Logs**

### **Simulation:**

To simulate the Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool, implement the following steps:

1. Develop a **DFD** to represent data flow from users to the network and database.
2. Create a **CFD** to visualize control structures, decision points, and loops.
3. Implement a prototype using tools like Python (Scapy, Nmap) and web technologies (React.js, Node.js).
