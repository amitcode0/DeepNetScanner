# Practical 6: Modeling UML Class Diagrams for a Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool

## Aim of the Experiment

To model **UML Class Diagrams** that represent the **structural and behavioral aspects** of a _Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool_ system.

---

## Introduction

This practical focuses on creating **UML class diagrams** to visualize the architecture of a **network security tool**. The system will **scan networks**, **capture packets**, and provide **analysis through a web interface**.

---

## Objectives

After completing this experiment, you will be able to:

- Identify and represent the key classes in a network scanning system
- Model relationships between classes including **associations**, **aggregations**, and **compositions**
- Represent the logical structure of a complex network security application
- Create a comprehensive **class diagram** for a web-based tool

---

## Theory

### Structural and Behavioral Aspects

- **Structural aspects** show the system's **static structure** (classes, attributes, methods)
- **Behavioral aspects** show how these classes **interact**

---

## Elements in Class Diagram

### Key Elements Include:

- Classes with **attributes** and **methods**
- **Relationships** (association, aggregation, composition, inheritance)
- **Interfaces**
- **Multiplicity indicators**

### Relationships

- **Composition**: Strong "whole-part" relationship  
  _E.g., `Packet` cannot exist without a `CaptureSession`_

- **Aggregation**: Weaker "whole-part" relationship

- **Generalization**: Inheritance relationships

## Case Study: Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool

### Proposed Class Diagram Structure:

---

## Key Classes and Relationships

- **User**: Represents system users with authentication details
- **NetworkScanner**: Handles network scanning operations
- **PacketCapture**: Manages packet capturing functionality
- **ScanResult**: Stores and manages scan results _(composition with NetworkScanner)_
- **ScanSettings**: Contains configuration for scans _(aggregation with NetworkScanner)_
- **PacketAnalysis**: Analyzes captured packets _(composition with PacketCapture)_

---

## Multiplicity Examples

- A **User** can initiate **many** scan operations (**1-to-many**)
- Each **NetworkScanner** has exactly **one** set of **ScanSettings** (**1-to-1**)
- One **PacketCapture** produces **many** **PacketAnalysis** objects (**1-to-many**)

---

## Implementation Notes

- Use proper **visibility indicators**:

  - `+` Public
  - `-` Private

- Include all essential **attributes** and **methods**

- Clearly show **relationship types** and **multiplicity**

- Consider adding **interfaces** for extensibility (e.g., `IScanner`, `IAnalyzer`)
