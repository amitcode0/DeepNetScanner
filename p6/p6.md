# Modeling UML Class Diagrams

## Structural and Behavioral Aspects

UML diagrams provide a graphical representation of a system’s design, depicting both structural and behavioral aspects. The **structural aspect** includes class diagrams, object diagrams, and component diagrams, while the **behavioral aspect** consists of use case diagrams, sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams.

## Class Diagram

A **Class Diagram** represents the static structure of a system by modeling its classes, attributes, operations, and relationships among objects. This diagram is essential for designing a system as it defines its fundamental building blocks.

### Aim of the Experiment

To develop and implement a **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool** that analyzes network traffic, detects security vulnerabilities, and monitors network activity in real time by designing a UML class diagram.

---

## Introduction

A **class diagram** is a fundamental UML diagram used to illustrate the relationships among classes in a system. It provides a blueprint for coding and serves as a foundation for system design and implementation.

---

## Objectives

After completing this experiment, you will be able to:

1. Graphically represent a class and associations among different classes.
2. Identify the logical sequence of activities in a system and represent them pictorially.
3. Understand the structural and behavioral components of a system.
4. Implement relationships between classes, including association, aggregation, and composition.

## Theory

### Structural and Behavioral Aspects

- **Structural**: Defines the components of the system, including classes and their attributes, operations, and relationships.
- **Behavioral**: Defines interactions between objects, including sequence and state transitions.

### Elements in a Class Diagram

A class diagram consists of the following elements:

1. **Class**: Represents an entity with attributes and methods.
2. **Attributes**: Properties defining a class.
3. **Methods**: Functions performed by the class.
4. **Relationships**: Defines associations among different classes.

### Relationships in a Class Diagram

1. **Association**: A basic relationship between classes.
2. **Aggregation**: A class contains another class but both can exist independently.
3. **Composition**: A strong form of aggregation where the child class cannot exist without the parent class.
4. **Inheritance (Generalization)**: One class inherits from another.
5. **Dependency**: One class depends on another.

## Case Study

### Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool

A network scanner and packet sniffing tool require multiple classes for managing different functionalities. Below is a high-level class diagram representation:

#### Classes and Their Relationships:

1. **User**  
   _Attributes_: UserID, Name, Role  
   _Relationship_: Interacts with **NetworkScanner**

2. **NetworkScanner**  
   _Attributes_: ScannerID, IPRange, Status  
   _Relationship_: Performs scanning and interacts with **PacketSniffer**

3. **PacketSniffer**  
   _Attributes_: SnifferID, Protocol, PacketDetails  
   _Relationship_: Analyzes network packets

4. **SecurityAnalyzer**  
   _Attributes_: AnalyzerID, ThreatLevel  
   _Relationship_: Detects security vulnerabilities and generates reports

5. **ReportManager**  
   _Attributes_: ReportID, Timestamp, AnalysisData  
   _Relationship_: Stores and manages scanning reports

### Class Diagram Representation:

- `User` → **Uses** → `NetworkScanner`
- `NetworkScanner` → **Has** → `PacketSniffer` _(Composition)_
- `PacketSniffer` → **Sends Data To** → `SecurityAnalyzer` _(Association)_
- `SecurityAnalyzer` → **Generates** → `ReportManager` _(Aggregation)_
