# Practical No-04: Modeling UML Use Case Diagrams and Capturing Use Case Scenarios

## Aim

The aim of this practical is to model UML Use Case Diagrams and capture Use Case Scenarios for a specific system. The system we are focusing on is a **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool**.

## Objective

The objective of this experiment is to:

- Learn how to create Use Case Diagrams in UML.
- Understand how to identify actors and use cases for a system.
- Establish relationships between actors and use cases.
- Capture Use Case Scenarios that describe how the system works.

This knowledge is essential for understanding how a system should function before development starts.

## Introduction

### What is a Use Case Diagram?

A **Use Case Diagram** is one of the **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** diagrams that represents the functional aspects of a system. It helps to visualize system requirements by showing:

- **Who interacts with the system?** (_Actors_)
- **What functionalities does the system provide?** (_Use Cases_)
- **How are these functionalities related?** (_Relationships_)

A **Use Case Diagram** acts as a bridge between developers, users, and stakeholders, ensuring that everyone understands what the system should do.

For this practical, we are designing a Use Case Diagram for a **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool**.

## Theory

### Elements of a Use Case Diagram

A **Use Case Diagram** consists of:

- **Actors** – The users or external systems interacting with the software.
- **Use Cases** – The actions or functions the system performs.
- **Relationships** – The links between actors and use cases.

### Types of Relationships in Use Case Diagrams

- **Association (Simple connection):** Connects an actor with a use case.
- **Generalization (Inheritance):** When an actor or use case inherits characteristics from another.
- **Include (Mandatory inclusion):** A use case always calls another use case.
- **Extend (Optional inclusion):** A use case adds extra behavior to another use case under certain conditions.

## Identifying Actors and Use Cases

To create a Use Case Diagram, we first identify the actors and use cases.

### Primary Actors (Main Users)

1. **Network Administrator** – Manages network scanning and packet sniffing.
2. **System User** – Uses the tool to monitor and analyze network traffic.

### Supporting Actors (External Systems)

1. **Database System** – Stores scanned results and logs.
2. **Firewall System** – Works with the tool to analyze network security.

### Identified Use Cases

The key functionalities (_Use Cases_) of the **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool** include:

1. **Perform Network Scan** – Scans the network for connected devices and open ports.
2. **Capture Network Packets** – Collects packets transmitted in the network.
3. **Analyze Network Traffic** – Examines network traffic for suspicious activities.
4. **Generate Reports** – Creates reports from collected network data.
5. **User Authentication** – Verifies the identity of users.
6. **Save Scan Logs** – Stores network scan results in a database.
7. **Configure Network Settings** – Allows administrators to configure network scan parameters.
8. **Filter Network Data** – Filters specific network packets based on criteria.

## Graphical Representation - Use Case Diagram

_(A UML Use Case Diagram should be drawn here, showing the actors, use cases, and relationships.)_

## Relationships Between Actors and Use Cases

### Network Administrator interacts with:

- **Perform Network Scan**
- **Configure Network Settings**
- **Save Scan Logs**
- **Generate Reports**

### System User interacts with:

- **Capture Network Packets**
- **Analyze Network Traffic**
- **Filter Network Data**

### Database System interacts with:

- **Save Scan Logs**
- **Retrieve Scan History**

### Firewall System interacts with:

- **Analyze Network Traffic**

## Use Case Relationships

### 1. **Include Relationship (Mandatory Dependency)**

- **"Generate Reports"** includes **"Analyze Network Traffic"**
  - _(Because reports cannot be generated without analyzing traffic.)_
- **"Perform Network Scan"** includes **"Save Scan Logs"**
  - _(Because scan results must be stored in the system.)_

### 2. **Extend Relationship (Optional Dependency)**

- **"Capture Network Packets"** extends **"Analyze Network Traffic"**
  - _(Because packet capture is an additional step in traffic analysis.)_
- **"Filter Network Data"** extends **"Capture Network Packets"**
  - _(Filtering happens only if the user applies filters to packet data.)_

## Case Study

### Scenario: Performing a Network Scan

#### 1. Precondition:

- The **Network Administrator** logs into the system.
- The administrator selects the type of scan (e.g., full network scan, port scan).

#### 2. Main Flow:

- The system initiates the **network scan**.
- It identifies **active devices** and **open ports**.
- The results are **displayed in real-time** on the interface.
- The system **saves the scan logs** in the database.

#### 3. Alternative Flow:

- If the scan **fails due to network issues**, an error message is displayed.
- The user can **retry the scan** after troubleshooting.

#### 4. Postcondition:

- **Scan results are stored** in the database.
- The administrator can **generate reports** based on the scan.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, we:

- Identified **actors** and **use cases** for the **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool**.
- Established **relationships** between actors and use cases.
- Created a **Use Case Diagram** to represent these interactions.
- Captured a detailed **use case scenario** to explain system behavior.

Understanding **Use Case Diagrams** helps software developers visualize system functionality, ensuring that all required features are well-defined before implementation.
