# Development and Implementation of a Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool that can:
- Analyze network traffic in real-time.
- Identify security vulnerabilities such as open ports, weak protocols, and malicious traffic.
- Provide real-time monitoring with alerts and reports.
- Enhance cybersecurity by detecting potential threats.

### 1.2 Importance of Scheduling in Project Management
Scheduling ensures:
- **Efficient task management** – Helps in breaking down work into smaller tasks.
- **Proper resource allocation** – Assigning the right people and tools to each task.
- **Timely project completion** – Avoids unnecessary delays in development.
- **Early detection of issues** – Identifies bottlenecks and helps in risk mitigation.

## 2. Task Identification & Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### 2.1 Key Components of the Project
The project is divided into different modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of network scanning and packet sniffing.

| Module | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Requirement Analysis | Gathering software/hardware requirements, setting project objectives |
| System Design | Creating the architecture of the web-based tool |
| Frontend Development | Building a web dashboard for users |
| Backend Development | Implementing network scanning and packet sniffing algorithms |
| Database Integration | Storing network logs and security reports |
| Security Implementation | Encrypting network logs and securing access |
| Testing & Debugging | Functional, performance, and security testing |
| Deployment & Maintenance | Hosting the application on a server and updating features |

### 2.2 Task Dependencies
- **Backend development** must be completed before frontend integration.
- **Security features** should be implemented after basic functionalities are tested.
- **Testing** should cover all possible network vulnerabilities before deployment.

## 3. Resource Scheduling

### 3.1 Required Resources
The project requires the following human, software, and hardware resources:

#### **Human Resources**

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|--------------|
| Project Manager | Oversees development & scheduling |
| Network Engineers (2) | Implement scanning & packet sniffing features |
| Frontend Developer (2) | Build the web interface for displaying results |
| Backend Developer (3) | Develop APIs, database integration, and logic for scanning/sniffing |
| Security Expert (1) | Implement security features and penetration testing |
| Tester (2) | Perform functional and security testing |

#### **Software Requirements**

| Software | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Python | For backend logic (network scanning & packet sniffing) |
| Scapy, Wireshark API | Packet sniffing and analysis |
| Nmap, Metasploit | Network scanning tools |
| React.js / Vue.js | Web frontend development |
| Django / Flask | Backend API development |
| MySQL / PostgreSQL | Database for storing network logs |
| Docker / Kubernetes | Deployment and scalability |

#### **Hardware Requirements**

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|------------|
| Web Server | Hosting the tool (Apache/Nginx) |
| Database Server | Storing network logs and reports |
| Network Interface Card (NIC) | Sniffing network packets |

### 3.2 Resource Allocation Plan
- **Frontend Developers** will work on the web interface using React.js/Vue.js.
- **Backend Developers** will implement network scanning and packet sniffing using Python (Scapy, Nmap, Wireshark API).
- **Network Engineers** will analyze vulnerabilities in the network and optimize scanning algorithms.
- **Security Experts** will focus on encrypting logs and protecting data.
- **Testers** will conduct penetration testing & debugging.

## 4. Creating the Gantt Chart

A Gantt chart helps visualize project progress over time. Below is a sample 6-month project timeline.

| Task | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 | Month 4 | Month 5 | Month 6 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Requirement Analysis | ✅ | | | | | |
| System Architecture Design | ✅ | ✅ | | | | |
| Frontend Development | | ✅ | ✅ | | | |
| Backend Development | | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | | |
| Database Integration | | | ✅ | ✅ | | |
| Security Implementation | | | | ✅ | ✅ | |
| Testing & Debugging | | | | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Deployment & Maintenance | | | | | ✅ | ✅ |

## 5. Monitoring & Risk Mitigation

### 5.1 Progress Monitoring Strategies
- **Daily Scrum Meetings** – Track progress and discuss roadblocks.
- **Version Control (GitHub/GitLab)** – Ensures code integrity and collaboration.
- **Issue Tracking (JIRA/Trello)** – Logs bugs and tracks issue resolution.
- **Automated Testing** – Prevents major bugs from reaching deployment.

### 5.2 Risk Factors & Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | Implement encryption & access controls |
| Network performance issues | Optimize packet capture & storage |
| Data loss in sniffing | Use database backups & logs |
| Unstable Web UI | Perform UI/UX testing before release |

## 6. Conclusion
