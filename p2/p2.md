# Practical No-02

## A. Aim of the Experiment

To develop and implement a Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing tool to analyze network traffic, detect security vulnerabilities, and monitor network activity in real-time.

## B. Problem Definition (Estimation of Project Metrics)

### Introduction to the Problem
With the increasing number of cyber threats, network security monitoring has become crucial for organizations. A network scanner helps identify connected devices, open ports, and potential vulnerabilities, while a packet sniffer captures and analyzes network traffic to detect anomalies.

### Challenges in Network Security
- **Unauthorized Access** – Attackers can exploit open ports to gain access to networks.
- **Data Leakage** – Sensitive information can be exposed through unencrypted network traffic.
- **Network Congestion** – High network usage can slow down performance.
- **Intrusion Detection** – Real-time monitoring is needed to detect malicious activities.

### Solution Approach
- Implement a web-based tool for scanning the network and capturing packets.
- Use estimation techniques (COCOMO, Halstead’s Complexity Metrics) to determine the cost, time, and effort required for development.
- Analyze the data to detect potential security threats.

## C. Introduction (Diagram)

### Overview of Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing
A network scanner maps the devices connected to a network, checks for open ports, and identifies potential vulnerabilities. A packet sniffer captures real-time network packets and analyzes them for security threats.

### Components of the System
1. **Web-Based Interface** – A GUI for users to enter scanning parameters and view results.
2. **Network Scanner** – Uses techniques like ARP scanning, Ping Sweeping, and Nmap scanning.
3. **Packet Sniffer** – Captures data packets using libraries like Scapy, Tshark, or Wireshark.
4. **Analysis Module** – Analyzes traffic for potential security issues such as malware, unauthorized access, and DoS attacks.
5. **Reporting System** – Generates reports on network vulnerabilities and traffic patterns.

*(Include a diagram showing the workflow: user inputs -> scanning -> packet capture -> analysis -> report generation.)*

## D. Theory (Diagram)

### 1. Objectives
After completing this experiment, you will be able to:
(a) Understand network scanning techniques and packet sniffing.
(b) Develop a web-based interface for performing network security analysis.
(c) Implement COCOMO and Halstead’s Complexity Metrics for estimating project effort and cost.
(d) Detect security threats using real-time packet capture and analysis.

### 2. Project Estimation Techniques

#### A. COCOMO Model (Constructive Cost Model)
COCOMO is used for estimating software development effort, cost, and time.

#### Types of COCOMO Models
- **Basic COCOMO** – Estimates project cost based on lines of code.
- **Intermediate COCOMO** – Considers additional factors like experience and complexity.
- **Detailed COCOMO** – Provides more accurate estimates by considering different phases of software development.

#### COCOMO Formula:
\[E = a(KLOC)^b\]

where:
- \(E\) = effort in person-months
- \(a, b\) = constants based on project type
- \(KLOC\) = thousands of lines of code

**Example Estimation for Network Scanner:**
- Estimated code size: **10,000 lines (10 KLOC)**
- Using Basic COCOMO for an organic project:
  \[E = 2.4 (10)^{1.05} \]
  \[E = 25.2\] person-months
- If a team has **5 developers**, the estimated duration = **5 months**.

#### B. Halstead’s Complexity Metrics
Used for estimating software complexity based on:
- **Operators & Operands** – Number of functions, variables, and operations used in the program.
- **Volume (V)** – Total size of the program in bits.
- **Effort (E)** – Amount of effort required for implementation.

#### Formula:
\[V = N \log_2(n)\]
where:
- \(N\) = Total number of operators and operands.
- \(n\) = Number of unique operators and operands.

### Advantages of Estimation Techniques:
✔ Helps in budget planning.
✔ Provides time estimation for project completion.
✔ Assists in identifying risk factors early.

### Drawbacks:
✖ May not be accurate for rapidly evolving projects.
✖ Requires historical data for better predictions.

## E. Simulation (If Available)

### Network Scanning:
Use **Nmap** to scan open ports and running services.
Example command:
```bash
nmap -A 192.168.1.1/24
```
Display results in a web-based dashboard.

### Packet Sniffing:
Use **Scapy** or **Wireshark** to capture network packets.
Example Python script:
```python
from scapy.all import sniff

def packet_callback(packet):
    print(packet.summary())

sniff(prn=packet_callback, count=10)
```
Show results on the web interface.

## F. Case Study

### Real-World Example: Packet Sniffing Attack Prevention
#### Incident:
In 2021, a company faced a **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** attack due to unencrypted traffic.

#### How Packet Sniffing Helped:
- The security team used a sniffer to detect unauthorized packet interceptions.
- It identified the attack source and blocked the malicious traffic.

#### Lesson Learned:
- Encrypt sensitive data using **TLS/SSL**.
- Implement **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**.

## H. Conclusion

- A **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing** tool is essential for network security analysis.
- **COCOMO & Halstead’s Metrics** help in estimating cost, effort, and complexity.
- **Network Scanning** identifies security vulnerabilities, while **Packet Sniffing** detects anomalies in real-time.
