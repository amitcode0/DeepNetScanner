## **Additional Notes for Your Project**

### **1. Requirements for Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing**

- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Network scanning (IP range, port scanning).
  - Packet capture and analysis.
  - Real-time monitoring and alerts.
  - User authentication and authorization.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - Scalability to handle large networks.
  - Security to prevent unauthorized access.
  - Performance to ensure minimal latency.

### **2. Tools and Technologies**

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript.
- **Frameworks**: Flask/Django for the web interface.

- **Database**: SQLite/MySQL for storing logs and reports.

### **3. Estimation Example**

- Using **COCOMO**, if the project is estimated to be 10,000 lines of code (LOC), the effort can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Effort} = a \times (\text{LOC})^b
  \]
  Where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants based on the project type.

# Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing - Project Estimation

## 1. Project Estimation Techniques

Project estimation involves calculating **effort, cost, and time** required for development. Common techniques include:

- **COCOMO Model** (Constructive Cost Model)
- **Function Point Analysis (FPA)**
- **Use Case Points (UCP)**

For this **cybersecurity-focused project**, we will use **COCOMO** for estimation.

---

## 2. COCOMO Model for Estimation

The **COCOMO Model** estimates **effort (E), time (T), and cost** based on **KLOC (thousands of lines of code).**

### **Project Type Classification**

A **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool** involves:

- Real-time packet analysis
- Web-based dashboard for visualization
- Backend for packet processing and logging

This makes it a **Semi-Detached Project** in COCOMO (Moderate Complexity).

### **COCOMO Basic Model Formula**
