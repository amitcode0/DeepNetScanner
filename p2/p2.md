# Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing - Project Estimation

## 1. Project Estimation Techniques

Project estimation involves calculating **effort, cost, and time** required for development. Common techniques include:

- **COCOMO Model** (Constructive Cost Model)
- **Function Point Analysis (FPA)**
- **Use Case Points (UCP)**

For this **cybersecurity-focused project**, we will use **COCOMO** for estimation.

## 2. COCOMO Model for Estimation

The **COCOMO Model** estimates **effort (E), time (T), and cost** based on **KLOC (thousands of lines of code).**

### **Project Type Classification**

A **Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing Tool** involves:

- Real-time packet analysis
- Web-based dashboard for visualization
- Backend for packet processing and logging

This makes it a **Semi-Detached Project** in COCOMO (Moderate Complexity).

### **COCOMO Basic Model Formula**

```
E = a Ã— (KLOC)^b
T = c Ã— (E)^d
```

Where:

- **E = Effort (in person-months)**
- **T = Time required (in months)**
- **KLOC = Estimated Lines of Code / 1000**
- **Constants for Semi-Detached**:
  - **a = 3.0, b = 1.12, c = 2.5, d = 0.35**

## 3. Estimating Effort & Time

### **Assumed KLOC for Project**

| Component                | Estimated LOC |
| ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Frontend (React)         | 7K            |
| Backend (FastAPI)        | 5K            |
| Packet Sniffing (Python) | 6K            |
| Database (MongoDB)       | 3K            |
| **Total LOC**            | **21K**       |

Thus, **KLOC = 21**.

### **Applying COCOMO Equations**

```
E = 3.0 Ã— (21)^1.12 = 3.0 Ã— 26.92 = 80.76 person-months
T = 2.5 Ã— (80.76)^0.35 = 2.5 Ã— 5.34 = 13.35 months
```

### **Effort and Time Estimation**

| Metric                     | Estimated Value  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Effort (Person-Months)** | **80.76 PM**     |
| **Time (Months)**          | **13.35 months** |

---

## 4. Cost Estimation

Cost depends on **developer salary**. If the **average developer salary is â‚¹50,000 per month**,

```
Total Cost = 80.76 Ã— 50,000 = â‚¹40,38,000
```

### **Team Size Adjustment**

| Team Size | Project Duration | Cost (â‚¹) |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------- |
| 1 Dev     | 13.35 months     | 40.38L   |
| 4 Devs    | 3.34 months      | 40.38L   |
| 6 Devs    | 2.22 months      | 40.38L   |

## 5. Summary

### **Project Estimation for Web-Based Network Scanner & Packet Sniffing**

| Factor                 | Value               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Project Type           | Semi-Detached       |
| Estimated KLOC         | 21K                 |
| Effort Required        | 80.76 Person-Months |
| Estimated Time (1 Dev) | 13.35 months        |
| Cost (â‚¹50K/Month)      | â‚¹40.38L             |

## 6. Additional Considerations

- **Security Testing & Compliance**: May increase cost & time.
- **Real-Time Performance Optimization**: Requires additional effort.
- **Scaling & Deployment**: Cloud-based solutions need extra resources.
